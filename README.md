##                                                     Compressed Sensing and its Applications

###                                                                    ABSTRACT

####            Compressed Sensing is one of the most important and highly sought-after signal processing technique used for the recovery and
#### reconstruction of signals. Compressed Sensing finds itself in many important applications like in Single Pixel Camera, MRI imaging, image 
#### recovery and preprocessing etc.

####            This project covers some of the important aspects of compressed sensing, how it is used for the group testing of COVID-19 during 
#### this pandemic, how we can apply the concept of ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) to solve the compressed sensing minimization
#### problem and also few applications of Compressed Sensing.
